<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>
The idea behind charitypins started when <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gsvolt">@gsvolt</a> and his friends started <a href="http://www.synhak.org">synhak</a>. We questioned.. "are there any other charities in Akron, Ohio that serve the maker community?". Sadly, there were no such resources to be found.
