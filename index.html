<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>
The idea behind charitypins started in 2012 when <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gsvolt">@gsvolt</a> and his friends <a href="https://gsvolt.wordpress.com/akronmakerspace/" target="_blank">started</a> <a href="https://www.akronmakerspace.org" target="_blank">The Akron Makerspace (formerly synhak)</a>. We questioned.. "are there any other charities in Akron, Ohio that serve the maker community?". Sadly, there were no such resources to be found.
</p>
<h2>The Requirements</h2>
<p>
Even though there are websites online as of today that deal with collecting information about charities (like how they manage their funds etc.), there isn't a resource online that can provide a map-first user interface for finding charities near you.

Logically, the following requirements were set to direct the project:
<ul>
<li>The website will provide a map interface and will accept one input - source street address</li>
<li>The output of the website will be pinned charities that IRS designates in good status near that source street address</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.irs.gov">IRS</a> on their website provides a list of all charities that according to them can accept donations.
